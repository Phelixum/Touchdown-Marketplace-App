TOUCHDOWN Marketplace App



Touchdown Marketplace or just simply ‘TOUCHDOWN’ is a prototype of an e-commerce application that focuses on Gridiron football/American football gear. American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby, and currently is the most popular sport in the United States and North America. 
Touchdown Marketplace is a mobile application that is designed using the SwiftUI framework as an interface toolkit. It has a simple design pattern, where you can observe different categories, brands, and products that the user could potentially buy. The main group of people who would be the potential users of the app would be the people that are engaged in the particular sport in any way, eg. professional athletes, casuals, schools that need equipment and etc.

It consists of a hard plastic shell with thick padding on the inside, a face mask made of one or more plastic-coated metal bars, and a chinstrap. Each position has a different type of face mask to balance protection and visibility, and some players add polycarbonate visors to their helmets, which are used to protect their eyes from glare and impacts. Helmets are a requirement at all levels of organized football."
