# Touchdown-Marketplace-App

Touchdown Marketplace or just simply ‘TOUCHDOWN’ is a prototype of an e-commerce
application that focuses on Gridiron football/American football gear. American football
evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby, and
currently is the most popular sport in the United States and North America.
Touchdown Marketplace is a mobile application that is designed using the SwiftUI
framework as an interface toolkit. It has a simple design pattern, where you can observe
different categories, brands, and products that the user could potentially buy. The main
group of people who would be the potential users of the app would be the people that
are engaged in the particular sport in any way, eg. professional athletes, casuals, schools
that need equipment and etc.
